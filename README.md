# rDisMELS_Basic
R package with basic functions to extract results from a DisMELS model run. 

This package is part of a refactoring of the wtsDisMELSConn R package. The latter originally provided "one-stop shopping" for R functions related to processing DisMELS model results, particularly for data extraction and connectivity analysis (hence the "Conn"), but it has become rather bloated and harder to maintain now that DisMELS itself has undergone a number of revisions and provided a more flexible approach to what model output for a given IBM will be.
